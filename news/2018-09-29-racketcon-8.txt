Talk at Eighth RacketCon

On 2018-09-29 I gave a talk at the `Eighth RacketCon <https://con.racket-lang.org/>`_ held from 2018-09-29 to 2018-09-30 in St. Louis, Missouri.

**Petri Net Flavored Places: An Advanced Transition System for Distributed Computing in Racket**

Places provide a way to specify parallel and distributed computation in
Racket. Using places we can set up independent services that communicate
via channels. Often state machines are used in this setting to model
session state, resource allocation, or service start order. However,
plain state machines often suffer from the explosion of the state space
as soon as multiple state variables appear in combination. Also some
applications have only an infinite representation, if modeled as a state
machine.

In this talk, we address these challenges by introducing pnet, a Racket
library that allows to define Racket places as Petri nets. Petri nets
are a class of transition systems representing state as tokens produced
and consumed by transitions. We consider several examples for Petri nets
as Racket places such as a worker pool and consider the possibility of
driving the pnet library from a tailor-made DSL or using it to construct
distributed programming languages.
