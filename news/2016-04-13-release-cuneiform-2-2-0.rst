Release Cuneiform 2.2.0
=======================

I have released `Cuneiform 2.2.0 <https://github.com/joergen7/cuneiform/releases/tag/2.2.0-release>`_. This is the first release of Cuneiform's Erlang implementation.

Cuneiform on Erlang comes with an overhauled interactive shell and HTCondor support. Currently only Bash, Perl, Python, and R are supported foreign languages. More languages will be supported in upcoming releases.
