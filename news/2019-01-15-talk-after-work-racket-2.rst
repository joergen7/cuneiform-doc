=======================

2019-01-15

On 2019-01-15 I gave a talk at `After Work Racket Episode 2 <https://www.meetup.com/After-Work-Racket/events/255710190/>`_ in Mainz, Germany.

Redex Language Models for Exploring a Distributed Programming Language
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Redex is a Racket library for modeling and exploring programming languages. Redex allows us to define an abstract syntax, a reduction relation, and judgment forms for type rules. I have used Redex to model Cuneiform, a distributed functional language. We discuss a simplified Redex model of Cuneiform and address how the language interacts with a distributed execution environment.
