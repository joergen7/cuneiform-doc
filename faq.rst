Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do another data flow language? Are there not enough languages already?**

Developers have conceived many data flow languages. The idea of programming with data flow is at least as old as `GNU Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_. But the build systems that we know of fall short of the expressive power of functional programming languages. By contrast, functional programming languages don't focus enough on software integration and parallelization.

**Parallelizing functional programs were big in the 1980s but never caught on. How does Cuneiform add to what we already have?**

We can only speculate about the reasons for the success or failure of the software projects of the 1980s. In our opinion, parallel functional programming would be commonplace if clock rates had not `doubled every 18 months <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>`_ for a long time. We catch up to these ideas, now that processor clock rates have been remaining mostly constant for a decade. Languages like Scala or Clojure are successful, in part, because many people understand that functional programming suits multi-processor systems. However, these languages, being general-purpose languages, are hybrids: some of their features are counter parallelism like mutable references or shared data structures. Cuneiform, being a special-purpose language, is focused: *all* of its features are easy to parallelize. And this special purpose approach is missing in the programming languages available today.

**Why does Cuneiform not support Ruby/Clojure/Julia?**

We aim to integrate as many languages as we can. If you do not find your favorite language on the list consider contributing.

**Cuneiform is a student project. Most students abandon their project after graduating. Who guarantees me that someone keeps working on Cuneiform?**

I do not make promises whether I will maintain Cuneiform in the future. Consider contributing.

**I understand the general idea behind Cuneiform. But can it be implemented?**

Currently, Cuneiform is in a beta stage of development. This means that the most important features are implemented and that we keep the user interface (the language) stable from now on. The package contains a Cuneiform interpreter and a distributed execution environment. So, I would argue we have indeed implemented it.

**Distributed computing is a complex research topic. E.g., scheduling or dealing with failures is hard. How can Cuneiform cover all these complexities?**

The way we deal with the complexities of distributed computing is twofold: (i) Many problems in this domain, like message passing or failure detection, are Erlang's turf. Here, we use what is already there. (ii) All other problems in this domain have simple solutions to which we default.

**Cunei-what? How did you come up with that name?**

Programming languages are writing systems. Cuneiform is one of the oldest writing systems we know about. So I thought it would be a fitting name for the least-old writing system around. Also, I was too ignorant to notice that there is already an open source `OCR software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CuneiForm_(software)>`_ with the same name.

**I have always got my work done. Do I really need all this fancy-schmancy recursive higher-order heiopei?**

Which language features are useful depends on the use case. It could be that the use cases you deal with really do not depend on features only a functional programming language can offer. In this case, you might be happy with the workflow language you already use. If, however, your use cases do depend on such features it might still be possible that you can get your work done somehow. I would think you are in for an improvement though.

**There are other well-known systems with active communities. No one knows Cuneiform and a community is pretty much non-existent. Why would I do this to myself?**

I am aware, that the risk profile of using Cuneiform is slightly higher than that of any other piece of software you can find out there.
