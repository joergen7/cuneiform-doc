Release Cuneiform 2.0.4
-----------------------

2016-04-11

I have switched Cuneiform to Erlang, which means that the Java implementation is about to be discontinued. The latest changes in the Java branch of Cuneiform have been subsumed in a `final version <https://github.com/joergen7/cuneiform/releases/tag/2.0.4-RELEASE>`_ tagged 2.0.4. It can also be obtained from the Download page.

Additionally, an implementation of only the `core semantics <https://github.com/joergen7/cf-java>`_ in Java is now available on GitHub. It is used by Hi-WAY to interpret Cuneiform workflows and may be the basis for independently maintained Cuneiform interpreters in the Java ecosystem.
